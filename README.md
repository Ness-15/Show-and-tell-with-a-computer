This project showcases a powerful machine learning-based app that combines multiple image processing tasks into a seamless interactive experience. The app allows users to upload images, and the machine learning model can perform several tasks, including object detection, image captioning, image generation, and storytelling based on the uploaded image.

Features
Object Detection
Detect and label multiple objects within the uploaded image using a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN). Bounding boxes are drawn around detected objects with labels and confidence scores.

Image Captioning
Automatically generate descriptive captions for the uploaded image using an image-to-text model (e.g., pre-trained model based on CNN + LSTM). The captions provide meaningful descriptions based on the content of the image.

Image Generation
Use the uploaded image as a reference to generate new, similar images using models like GANs or diffusion models. The generated images provide variations on the original image, demonstrating creative image synthesis.

Storytelling
Generate a short, creative story based on the uploaded image. Using a pre-trained language model, the app can analyze the visual content of the image and create a unique narrative, bringing the image to life.
